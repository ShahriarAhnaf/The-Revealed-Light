Building a cross platform Mobile App using react native and EXPO client to access native libraries

Goal is to have an offline Qsran reading app with good functionality and an excellent reading experience

Learning goals of this project is to learn app deployment and software development workflow. I am trying to get used to CLI for git hub
and this type of project is perfect to continue working on my version control skills. 

All React native learning is happening from the excellent youtuber and teacher [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-S5a0eXPoc&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh)
